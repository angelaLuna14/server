 After the incident at Black Mesa, the government
seized the facility in hopes of containing the
events that took place there.  In the heart of the
facility lies important information concerning 
the events, and we sent in 3 special operatives 
to extract the information and retrieve it.  Due 
to unforseen circumstances, the miltary seized 
the team and has imprisoned them within the Black 
Mesa warehouse district.  Although risky, we feel 
that the SvenCoop team is fully capiable of taking
on the much larger force and rescuing our operatives.
You will be sent in with minimal weapons, to slip by 
the security shield.  Once inside though, use brute 
force to gain entry.  We will contact you again 
inside the facility...
