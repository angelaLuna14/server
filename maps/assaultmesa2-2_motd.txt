 The progress made thus far has impressed all here
at HQ.  In the blueprints we have obtained, the
Central Sewer system that you are in leads to the
abandoned storage buildings.  Beware that these
have not seen use in many many years.  Expect 
resistance as you near the surface, as you will
come up very close to the warehouse with the 
operatives.  Remember if they cannot be rescued
for any reason, do not hesitate to extinguish them.
They still have extremely sensitive information 
about SvenCoop, which can not fall into enemy hands.
After you meet the rest of the team, head to the 
airfield to wait extraction.  Be extremely careful,
our Xen teleportation monitor are showing signs like
the ones during the Incident...
