One week ago, Alien forces launched an underground attack on a remote military base. We "thought" it was under control until we started receiving strange communications from the base.  They were asking for, "food nipples with cheese," and demanding that we "send a giant pie to bathe in." Communications then ceased and we have concluded that the aliens have warped the base personnel’s minds into believing that they serve their alien "masters." 

We have decided to send your squad in to investigate this matter since your previous engagements involving these Aliens have been quite successful.  Your orders are to investigate the facility and neutralize all hostile forces. Also note that strange readings have been noticed in a deep underground chamber.  Consequently, the readings have led us to believe that this is the origin of the base personal mind warping. Good luck, and if you start to feel odd get out of there as quick as you can.
 
          Sincerely,
                       General Seraph
