Location : Entrance to Warehouse Complex

Your Black Ops team has almost made it out of the warehouses, now you must get through the heavy military presence above ground and head towards the helipads located near the central complex. Warning a Military command unit is in this area and is under control of the "G-man" so expect more co-ordinated resistance.
