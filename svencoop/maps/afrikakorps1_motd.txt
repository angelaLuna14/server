=====================Afrika Korps 1===================

Location: North Afrika

Hello Lieutenant,

Rommel's afrika korps has taken a town in North Afrika. Your teams mission is to steal the war documents and any other secret documents in the area. Also you have to Locate and destroy the sensitive radar and communication equipment before they can transmit the secret war documents. The afrika korps has set up defense points with mg42's that you will have to disable. If you spot a German tank, destroy it with a bazooka in the area. Once you have the war documents exit the town in the west.


With any luck, we'll force Rommel and the Afrika Korps out of North Africa soon enough.

Dwight D. Eisenhower
