Location : Black mesa Warehouse complex

Situation : The research complex Black Mesa is in chaos. Alien Life forms have flooded the majority of the complex, taking over key locations. The military has been sent in to clean up. However someone is manipulating the operations of the military, and stealing our scientists. The person responsible for this is the so called "G-man". We have very little information on this individual, This person is directly responsible for the disappearance of key personnel, including a Mr. Freeman. He is also now recruiting key military servicemen. He is using our people against us. This situation is not acceptable! 

Mission: To locate the "G-man" and terminate him
