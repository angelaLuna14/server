MAP : CITY_INVASION
AUTHOR : Foofinoo


**Story**

"According to our scientists and their advanced sensors, 
there is a lot of 'alien' activity near this old factory...

We have already sent a first group of grunts yesterday, 
but they didn't give a sign of life since a few hours...

So, you know what to do : find what happened and
rescue your teammates if they are still alive..."


**Notes**

I finally did it !!
I've start the map around 3 or 4 months ago (if it's not even more), and it's finally finished !!
As always, I had lot of stuff to do and so I didn't find the time to seriously work on it...
But I guess it's not so bad, even if I got lot of problems with the map itself... 

Since it's my first Sven Co-op map, I had to use scripts and spawn monsters for the first time with GoldSource.
And I won't say it's hard, but it's more complicated than a Source map... And it don't always work...
So, I had to remove some special things, and I'm a bit disappointed about it...

Well, honestly, I'm fed up of working on this map.
I'm really happy to release it, I will be able to move to another thing finally...

Also, because It's my first Sven Co-op map (and very likely my last one), if I've forget anything, tell me in the comments.
