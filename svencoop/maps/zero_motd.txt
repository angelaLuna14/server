This is a transmission to anyone still alive in the Black Mesa Facility. As I'm sure most of you will know, the facilities big "experiment" was a disastrous failure. It seems a portal to a world known only as Xen has been opened, and we've gathered the inhabitants of this world are not to pleased at us finding them. It also turns out our facility was littered with government spies, so we're now going to be swept under the carpet as part of the cleanup operation.

 It is vital you are successful in contacting the Lambda team. They will play a key role in helping at least some of the staff escape. It will also be vital for exposing the corruption of the government and its attempt at covering up a vital scientific discovery.

Good luck my friends, we're counting on you!
